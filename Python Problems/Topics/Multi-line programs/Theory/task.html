<h2>Multi-line programs</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>We hope you have learned how to write simple, single-line Python programs that print text. However, real programs contain many lines: from tens or hundreds of lines for small scripts to thousands and even more for large projects. So, in this lesson, you will write programs that print multiple lines.</p><h5 id="ways-of-printing-multiple-lines">Ways of printing multiple lines</h5><p>Let's consider an example. The following code prints exactly three strings, each on a new line:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print("I")
print("know")
print("Python")</code></pre><p>The output is:</p><pre><code class="language-python">I
know
Python</code></pre><p>You can run this example using <a href="https://repl.it/languages/python3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this website</a> or locally if you have installed Python on your computer.</p><p>There are ways to print the above text using one function call. We will consider them in the following topics.</p><p>The <code class="language-python">print</code> function also allows you to print an empty line with no string specified:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print("I")
print()
print("know")
print("")
print("Python")</code></pre><p>Here's the output:</p><pre><code class="language-python">I

know

Python</code></pre><p>Note that <code class="language-python">print()</code> and <code class="language-python">print("")</code> give the same result!</p><p>However, skipping a line in your code will have no effect.</p><pre><code class="language-python">print("And")

print("you?")</code></pre><p>The output of the above code is:</p><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">And
you?</code></pre><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>In this short lesson, we learned how to deal with multi-line texts with the help of <code class="language-python">print()</code>. Now it's time to solve some problems.</p>
